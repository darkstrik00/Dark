### Important

* In order for the logging to work, your account must have a profile picture different than the standard discord one.

### Replit
Replit can't be used anymore: https://gist.github.com/kyan0045/c5867763f9df50a5f54f501c14f3a846

* If you wish to run our autocatcher on Replit, we strongly recommend you to use Replit's secret feature, to prevent people from stealing your tokens and webhook. You can find the steps to creating a secret below.
